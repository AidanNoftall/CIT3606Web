                My cars are very important to me, and I enjoy working and driving them in my free time. I've included a few pictures of the two cars I currently own!
                The car on the left is my 2009 Audi A4 3.2 Quattro, and the car on the right is my 1977 Chevrolet Corvette L82 4 Speed.
                The Audi is my daily driver, and the Corvette is my weekend car that I take to car shows and cruise.
